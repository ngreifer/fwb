# fwb: Fractional Weighted Bootstrap

An implementation of the fractional weighted bootstrap to be used as a
drop-in for functions in the 'boot' package. The fractional weighted
bootstrap (also known as the Bayesian bootstrap) involves drawing
weights randomly that are applied to the data rather than resampling
units from the data. See Xu et al. (2020)

for details.
