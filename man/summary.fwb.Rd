\usage{
\method{summary}{fwb}(
  object,
  conf = 0.95,
  ci.type = "bc",
  p.value = FALSE,
  index = 1L:ncol(object$t),
  ...
)

\method{confint}{fwb}(object, parm, level = 0.95, ci.type = "bc", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an \code{fwb} object; the output of a call to \code{\link[=fwb]{fwb()}}.}

\item{conf, level}{the desired confidence level. Default is .95 for 95\% confidence intervals.}

\item{ci.type}{the type of confidence interval desired. Allowable options include \code{"wald"} (Wald interval), \code{"norm"} (normal approximation), \code{"basic"} (basic interval), \code{"perc"} (percentile interval), \code{"bc"} (bias-correct percentile interval), and \code{"bca"} (bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] interval). Only one is allowed. BCa intervals require that the number of bootstrap replications is larger than the sample size. See \code{\link[=fwb.ci]{fwb.ci()}} for details. The default is \code{"bc"}.}

\item{p.value}{\code{logical}; whether to display p-values for the test that each parameter is equal to 0. The p-value is computed using a Z-test with the test statistic computed as the ratio of the estimate to its bootstrap standard error. This test is only valid when the bootstrap distribution is normally distributed around 0 and is not guaranteed to agree with any of the confidence intervals. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{index, parm}{the index or indices of the position of the quantity of interest in \code{x$t0} if more than one was specified in \code{fwb()}. Default is to display all quantities.}

\item{...}{ignored.}
}
\value{
For \code{summary()}, a \code{summary.fwb} object, which is a matrix with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Estimate}: the statistic estimated in the original sample
\item \verb{Std. Error}: the standard deviation of the bootstrap estimates
\item \verb{CI \{L\}\%} and \verb{CI \{U\}\%}, the upper and lower confidence interval bounds computed using the argument to \code{ci.type}.
}

When \code{p.value = TRUE}, two additional columns, \verb{z value} and \verb{Pr(>|z|)}, are included containing the z-statistic and p-value for each computed statistic, respectively.

For \code{confint()}, a matrix with a row for each statistic and a column for the upper and lower confidence interval limits.
}
\description{
\code{summary()} creates a regression summary-like table that displays the bootstrap estimates, their empirical standard errors, and their confidence intervals. \code{confint()} produces just the confidence intervals, which are computed using \code{\link[=fwb.ci]{fwb.ci()}}, and is called internally by \code{summary()}.

set.seed(123, "L'Ecuyer-CMRG")
data("infert")

fit_fun <- function(data, w) {
  fit <- glm(case ~ spontaneous + induced, data = data,
             family = "quasibinomial", weights = w)
  coef(fit)
}

fwb_out <- fwb(infert, fit_fun, R = 199,
               verbose = FALSE)

# Basic confidence interval for both estimates
summary(fwb_out, ci.type = "basic")

# Just for "induced" coefficient; p-values requested
summary(fwb_out, index = "induced", p.value = TRUE)
