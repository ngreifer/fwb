Added new function fwb.array() extract bootstrap weights fwb object. Confidence intervals can suppressed summary() setting conf = 0. Fixed bug confint(), fwb.ci(), summary() confidence level low .5. Now levels low just 0 allowed, except computing simultaneous Wald confidence intervals. BCa confidence intervals computed faster confint() summary(). functions longer use fwb.ci() internally. Added new tidy() method summary.fwb objects.","code":""},{"path":"https://ngreifer.github.io/fwb/news/index.html","id":"fwb-040","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"fwb 0.4.0","title":"fwb 0.4.0","text":"CRAN release: 2025-06-11 Added suite new functions computing weighted statistic transformations automatically incorporate bootstrap weights. include w_mean(), w_var(), w_sd(), w_quantile(), w_median() computing weighted means, variances, standard deviations, quantiles, medians; w_cov() w_cor() computing weighted covariance correlation matrices, w_std(), w_scale(), w_center() transforming variables standardizing, scaling, centering using weighted statistics. work called inside function supplied statistic argument fwb() inside model supplied vcovFWB().
